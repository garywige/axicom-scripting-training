# PowerShell Scripting

This project is an attempt at teaching a programming novice how to code using PowerShell. PowerShell is an excellent scripting language to use on Windows. For small "console" apps that don't require a fancy GUI, there's a good chance that PowerShell can do what you need it to. If you are new to PowerShell and interested in learning it, please open the [README.md file in the Lesson 1 folder](./Lesson%201) to get started.
