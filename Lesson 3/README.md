# Lesson 3

## Introduction

In the last lesson, you learned a lot of new PowerShell tools you can use to control the flow of your scripts. In this lesson, we are going to apply what we've learned to create a practical example. By the end of this lesson, you will have constructed a script that copies a source directory chosen by the user to a destination directory also chosen by the user. It will also offer 3 different modes that can be used for different scenarios: OverwriteAll, OverwriteNone, and OverwriteOld. You will find that this script will be much more resilient than the original one you created.
